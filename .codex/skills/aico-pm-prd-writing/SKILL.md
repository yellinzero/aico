  Create comprehensive Product Requirements Documents (PRD) that define what to build and why, focusing on goals, scope, user stories, and success criteria without implementation details.

  Use this skill when:
  - User asks to "write a PRD", "create PRD", "write requirements document"
  - User mentions "requirements document", "product requirements", "product spec"
  - Running /pm.plan command to create version planning document
  - Starting a new product, major feature, or initiative that needs formal requirements
  - Need to document goals, scope, user stories, functional requirements, and success criteria

  Output: ALWAYS write PRD files to docs/reference/pm/versions/{version-name}.md

# PRD Writing

## Language Configuration

Before generating any content, check `aico.json` in project root for `language` field to determine the output language. If not set, default to English.

## Process

1. **Gather context**: Check `docs/reference/pm/` for existing product context
2. **Define problem & solution**: Start with clear problem statement and high-level solution
3. **Set boundaries**: Clearly separate Goals from Non-Goals
4. **Document requirements**: List functional requirements (FR-XXX format)
5. **Define success**: Set measurable success criteria
6. **Track unknowns**: Document open questions for later clarification
7. **Save PRD**: ALWAYS write to `docs/reference/pm/versions/{version-name}.md`

## PRD Template

```markdown
# [Feature Name] PRD

> Project: [project-name]
> Created: YYYY-MM-DD
> Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD

## 1. Overview

- Problem statement
- Proposed solution (high-level)
- Success metrics

## 2. Background

- Current state
- User pain points
- Market context (if relevant)

## 3. Goals & Non-Goals

### Goals

- What this feature WILL accomplish

### Non-Goals

- What this feature will NOT address

## 4. User Stories

[Link to or embed user stories]

## 5. Functional Requirements

- FR-001: [Requirement description]
- FR-002: [Requirement description]

## 6. User Experience

- Key user flows
- Interaction patterns
- Edge cases

## 7. Success Criteria

- Measurable outcomes
- Acceptance criteria

## 8. Open Questions

- Unresolved decisions
- Items needing clarification
```

## Key Rules

- ALWAYS focus on WHAT to build, NOT HOW to implement
- MUST include quantifiable success metrics
- ALWAYS explicitly state what's out of scope in Non-Goals
- MUST save output to `docs/reference/pm/versions/` directory

## Common Mistakes

- ❌ Include implementation details → ✅ Focus on WHAT, not HOW
- ❌ Vague success metrics → ✅ Quantifiable outcomes
- ❌ Missing non-goals → ✅ Explicitly state what's out of scope

## Iron Law

**NO PRD WITHOUT VALIDATED REQUIREMENTS**

This rule is non-negotiable. Before writing PRD:

1. User pain points must be documented
2. Success metrics must be defined
3. Scope must be explicitly approved by user

### Rationalization Defense

| Excuse                          | Reality                                 |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| "Requirements are clear enough" | Implicit requirements cause scope creep |
| "We can refine the PRD later"   | Late changes cost 10x more to implement |
| "User will accept anything"     | Users always have hidden expectations   |
| "It's just a small feature"     | Small features grow into big problems   |
