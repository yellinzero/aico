I have a vague idea about building a tool to help developers manage AI collaboration.
I'm not sure exactly how to approach it. Can you help me clarify my thoughts?

The main issue is that when using Claude Code, I have to repeatedly explain the same instructions and workflows every time, which is tedious.
