I'm not sure about some aspects of this requirement and need clarification:

"Users can add employees to projects"

Questions:
1. What is an employee? A skill package or a complete AI configuration?
2. How do users add them? CLI or graphical interface?
3. Where does the employee data come from? Local or cloud?

Can you help me analyze these questions?
