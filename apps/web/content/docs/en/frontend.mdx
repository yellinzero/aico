Full-stack frontend development: design system extraction, page design, task breakdown, and implementation with TDD approach.

## Installation

```bash
aico add @the-aico/frontend
```

## Skills

### init

Initialize frontend environment by creating design system and constraints documents from templates.

**Use when:**

- Running `/frontend.init` command
- User asks to "initialize frontend", "setup frontend environment"
- Starting frontend work and need to establish design system and constraints
- Need to create `docs/reference/frontend/design-system.md` or `constraints.md`

### style-extraction

Extract design tokens (colors, typography, spacing, effects) from reference website or screenshot to create project design system.

**Use when:**

- User shares reference website URL and wants to extract its style
- User provides screenshot or image and asks to "extract design", "extract style"
- Running `/frontend.init` and need to create design system from reference
- User asks to "create design system", "extract colors", "extract typography"
- Need to establish consistent design tokens before starting frontend work

### design

Transform PRD or story into complete page/component designs with ASCII layouts, component specs, interaction flows, and frontend implementation prompts.

**Use when:**

- User asks to "design the page", "design component", "create page design"
- User mentions "page design", "component design", "UI design", "layout design"
- Running `/frontend.design` command
- PRD or story is ready and need visual/interaction design before implementation
- Need to create design spec that frontend developer can implement from

### task-breakdown

Break down PM story into frontend tasks following UI development order: Setup → Static UI → Dynamic Logic → Interactions → Testing.

**Use when:**

- Running `/frontend.tasks` command
- User asks to "break down story", "create frontend tasks", "split into tasks"
- Have story at `docs/reference/pm/stories/` and need organized task list
- Need tasks ordered by UI development layers (not random order)
- Starting frontend work and want organized task list

### plan

Create atomic implementation plan for a single frontend task. Each step has exact code and verification command.

**Use when:**

- Running `/frontend.plan` command
- User explicitly asks for "atomic steps", "step-by-step plan with verification"
- Have a specific task from `docs/reference/frontend/tasks/` and need implementation steps
- Need granular steps: Setup (create files) → Implementation (write code) → Test (verify) → Commit

**Do NOT use for:**

- Architecture planning (use EnterPlanMode)
- General development planning
- Feature scoping or estimation

### implement

Execute frontend implementation with TDD. Read all constraint files before coding, write failing test first, verify after each step.

**Use when:**

- User asks to "implement this", "implement the plan", "start implementation", "execute plan"
- Have an implementation plan ready and need to execute it
- Executing steps from `/frontend.plan` output
- User says "start coding", "write the code", "begin implementation"
- User asks to "use TDD", "write test first", "test-driven" for frontend code
- User asks to "write tests", "add tests", "create tests"
- Fixing UI bugs (write failing test that reproduces bug first)

**TDD Iron Law:** No production code without a failing test first.

## Commands

### /frontend.init

Initialize frontend constraints file with project-specific configurations.

```bash
/frontend.init
```

Creates configuration documenting:

- Tech stack (React, Vue, etc.)
- Styling approach (Tailwind, CSS modules, etc.)
- Component patterns
- Testing requirements

### /frontend.design

Generate page/component design specs from PRD or requirements.

```bash
/frontend.design "User profile page"
```

Produces:

- Component hierarchy
- State management approach
- API integration points
- Responsive breakpoints

### /frontend.tasks

Break down a story into frontend tasks with progress tracking.

```bash
/frontend.tasks S-001
```

Creates atomic task list:

- Each task is independently implementable
- Clear acceptance criteria
- Estimated complexity

### /frontend.plan

Create atomic implementation plan for a specific task.

```bash
/frontend.plan FE-001
```

Produces step-by-step implementation guide.

├── constraints.md       # Project constraints

## Workflow

1. **Extract** design system from existing code (`style-extraction`)
2. **Design** pages/components from requirements (`design`)
3. **Break down** into atomic tasks (`task-breakdown`)
4. **Plan** each task implementation (`plan`)
5. **Implement** with TDD approach (`implement`)
