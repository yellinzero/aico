Full-stack backend development: API design, database architecture, business logic implementation, and system design with TDD approach.

## Installation

```bash
aico add @the-aico/backend
```

## Skills

### init

Initialize backend environment by creating constraints document from template.

**Use when:**

- Running `/backend.init` command
- User asks to "initialize backend", "setup backend environment"
- Starting backend work and need to establish tech stack and conventions
- Need to create `docs/reference/backend/constraints.md`

### task-breakdown

Break down PM story into backend tasks following layered architecture order: Data Models → Database → Repository → Service → API → Validation → Tests.

**Use when:**

- Running `/backend.tasks` command
- User asks to "break down story for backend", "create backend tasks", "split into backend tasks"
- Have story at `docs/reference/pm/stories/` and need organized task list
- Need tasks ordered by architectural layers (not random order)
- Starting backend work and want organized, layered task list

### plan

Create atomic implementation plan for a single backend task. Each step has TDD, exact code, and verification command.

**Use when:**

- Running `/backend.plan` command
- User explicitly asks for "atomic steps", "step-by-step plan with verification"
- Have a specific task from `docs/reference/backend/tasks/` and need implementation steps
- Need granular TDD steps: Types → DB → Test (failing) → Implementation → Test (passing) → API

**Do NOT use for:**

- Architecture planning (use EnterPlanMode)
- General development planning
- Feature scoping or estimation

### implement

Execute backend implementation with TDD (Test-Driven Development). Write failing test first, then implement, verify each step.

**Use when:**

- User asks to "implement this backend task", "implement backend"
- Have an implementation plan ready and need to execute it
- Executing steps from `/backend.plan` output
- User says "start coding backend", "write backend code"
- User asks to "use TDD", "write test first", "test-driven" for backend code
- Fixing backend bugs (write failing test that reproduces bug first)

**TDD Iron Law:** No production code without a failing test first.

## Commands

### /backend.init

Initialize backend constraints file with project-specific configurations.

```bash
/backend.init
```

Creates configuration documenting:

- Tech stack (Node.js, Python, Go, etc.)
- Framework (Express, FastAPI, etc.)
- Database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
- API style (REST, GraphQL)
- Authentication approach
- Testing requirements

### /backend.tasks

Break down a story into backend tasks with progress tracking.

```bash
/backend.tasks S-001
```

Creates atomic task list:

- Database schema changes
- API endpoints
- Business logic
- Integration tests

### /backend.plan

Create atomic implementation plan for a specific task.

```bash
/backend.plan BE-001
```

Produces step-by-step implementation guide including:

- Database migrations
- API contracts
- Error handling
- Test cases

## Document Structure

```txt
docs/reference/backend/
├── constraints.md       # Project constraints
└── tasks/
    └── BE-001.md        # Task definitions
```

---

## Workflow

1. **Initialize** project constraints (`init`)
2. **Break down** stories into tasks (`task-breakdown`)
3. **Plan** each task implementation (`plan`)
4. **Implement** with TDD approach (`implement`)

---

## API Design Principles

The backend employee follows these principles:

- **Contract-first:** Define API contracts before implementation
- **TDD:** Write tests before implementation code
- **Incremental:** Small, reviewable changes
- **Documented:** Auto-generate API documentation
