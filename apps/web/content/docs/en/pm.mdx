## Skills

### init

Initialize PM environment by creating constitution document from template.

**Use when:**

- Running `/pm.init` command
- User asks to "initialize PM", "setup product management", "create constitution"
- Starting a new project and need to establish product constraints and domain info
- Need to create `docs/reference/pm/constitution.md` for a new project

### brainstorming

Guide users through structured dialogue to transform vague ideas into clear, actionable product concepts.

**Use when:**

- User says "I have an idea", "I want to build", "let me think about"
- User mentions "brainstorm", "explore ideas", "think through"
- Requirements are vague, incomplete, or user seems unsure what they want
- Need to explore problem space before jumping to solutions
- Running `/pm.plan` but requirements are unclear or missing context
- User asks "what should I build?", "how should this work?"

**Approach:**

- One question at a time
- Multiple choice over open-ended questions
- Explore 2-3 alternatives before deciding

### clarification

Resolve requirement ambiguities through structured questioning: one question at a time, with recommended options and reasoning.

**Use when:**

- Running `/pm.clarify` command
- User says "unclear", "not sure what this means", "confused about"
- User asks "what does X mean?", "how should X work?", "can you clarify?"
- Requirements have conflicting or inconsistent details
- Stories are missing acceptance criteria or have gaps
- Need to fill information gaps before development can proceed

### prd-writing

Create comprehensive Product Requirements Documents (PRD) that define what to build and why.

**Use when:**

- User asks to "write a PRD", "create PRD", "write requirements document"
- User mentions "requirements document", "product requirements", "product spec"
- Running `/pm.plan` command to create version planning document
- Starting a new product, major feature, or initiative that needs formal requirements
- Need to document goals, scope, user stories, functional requirements, and success criteria

### user-story-writing

Transform requirements into well-structured User Stories using "As a [user], I want [goal], So that [benefit]" format.

**Use when:**

- User asks to "write user story", "create story", "add story"
- User mentions "user story", "backlog item", "story"
- Running `/pm.plan` and need to break PRD into implementable stories
- Creating backlog items for development team
- Need to formalize a requirement into standard story format
- Converting feature request into actionable story with acceptance criteria

### acceptance-criteria

Define clear, testable acceptance criteria using Given/When/Then (Gherkin) format.

**Use when:**

- User asks for "acceptance criteria", "AC", "test criteria", "done criteria"
- User asks "how do we know it's done?", "what counts as complete?"
- User story needs testable success conditions
- QA needs test scenarios or test cases
- Running `/pm.plan` and need to add AC to stories
- Reviewing story and AC is missing or vague

### competitor-analysis

Research and analyze competitors with structured output: feature comparison matrix, strengths/weaknesses analysis, and actionable recommendations.

**Use when:**

- User asks "what do competitors do?", "who are our competitors?"
- User mentions competitor names or asks for product comparison
- User asks for "competitor analysis", "market research", "competitive landscape"
- Entering new market, feature area, or evaluating product direction
- Need to understand competitive landscape before making product decisions
- Writing PRD and need market context or differentiation strategy

### story-acceptance

Verify and close stories after frontend/backend tasks are completed. Check ALL related task files, update story acceptance criteria checkboxes.

**Use when:**

- Frontend or backend notifies "task completed, please verify"
- User asks to "verify story", "accept story", "close story", "mark story done"
- Need to check if a story can be marked as complete
- User asks "is story X done?", "can we close story X?"
