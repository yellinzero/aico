If not set, default to English.\n\n## Process\n\n1. **Read task**: Get details from `docs/reference/backend/tasks/{story}.md`\n2. **Read constraints**: Load `docs/reference/backend/constraints.md`\n3. **Break into atomic steps** following this order:\n   - Types/interfaces first\n   - Database migrations\n   - Failing tests (TDD)\n   - Implementation to pass tests\n   - API routes\n   - Verification\n4. **Keep steps atomic**: One action per step\n5. **Present plan to user** (do not save to file)\n\n## Plan Format\n\n````markdown\n# [Task Name] - Implementation Plan\n\n> Project: [project-name]\n> Created: YYYY-MM-DD\n> Task: [task description]\n> Estimated steps: N\n\n## Step 1: [Action]\n\n**Files**:\n\n- Create: `src/types/user.ts`\n\n**Action**:\n[Exact code]\n\n**Verify**:\n\n```bash\nnpx tsc --noEmit\n```\n````\n\nExpected: No errors\n\n```\n\n## Step Order\n\n| Order | Step Type | Purpose |\n|-------|-----------|---------|\n| 1 | Types | Define interfaces and DTOs |\n| 2 | Database | Create migrations |\n| 3 | Test (RED) | Write failing test |\n| 4 | Implement (GREEN) | Write code to pass test |\n| 5 | API | Add routes |\n| 6 | Commit | Stage and commit |\n\n## Step Granularity\n\n| Good Steps | Bad Steps |\n|------------|-----------|\n| Create type file with interface | Create entire model with methods |\n| Write one failing test | Write all tests |\n| Implement single method | Implement entire service |\n| Add one route | Add all routes |\n\n## Key Rules\n\n- ALWAYS write failing test before implementation (TDD)\n- MUST include verification command for each step\n- ALWAYS follow order: Types → DB → Test → Impl → API\n- NEVER combine multiple actions into one step\n\n## Common Mistakes\n\n- ❌ Steps too large → ✅ One action per step\n- ❌ Skip verification → ✅ Every step has verify command\n- ❌ Implementation before test → ✅ TDD: test first\n- ❌ Vague actions → ✅ Include exact code\n```\n"
