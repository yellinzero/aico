Tasks are ordered by architectural layers, not random order.\n\n  Use this skill when:\n  - Running /backend.tasks command\n  - User asks to \"break down story for backend\", \"create backend tasks\", \"split into backend tasks\"\n  - Have story at docs/reference/pm/stories/ and need organized task list\n  - Need tasks ordered by architectural layers (not random order)\n  - Starting backend work and want organized, layered task list\n\n  Layer order is CRITICAL: Types/Entities → Migrations → Repository → Service → API → Validation → Tests\n  Output: ALWAYS write to docs/reference/backend/tasks/{story-name}.md\n---\n\n# Task Breakdown\n\n## Language Configuration\n\nBefore generating any content, check `aico.json` in project root for `language` field to determine the output language. If not set, default to English.\n\n## Process\n\n1. **Read story/PRD**: Load from `docs/reference/pm/stories/` or `docs/reference/pm/versions/`\n2. **Identify data entities**: What domain objects are needed\n3. **Identify API endpoints**: What routes are needed\n4. **Identify business logic**: What services are needed\n5. **Break into tasks**: Follow layered architecture order\n6. **Save output**: ALWAYS write to `docs/reference/backend/tasks/{story-name}.md`\n\n## Layered Architecture Order\n\n```\n1. Data Models (types, entities, DTOs)\n      ↓\n2. Database (migrations, schema)\n      ↓\n3. Repository Layer (data access)\n      ↓\n4. Service Layer (business logic)\n      ↓\n5. API Layer (controllers, routes)\n      ↓\n6. Validation & Error Handling\n      ↓\n7. Tests (unit, integration, API)\n```\n\n## Task File Template\n\n```markdown\n# [Story Name] - Backend Tasks\n\n> Project: [project-name]\n> Created: YYYY-MM-DD\n> Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD\n> Source: docs/reference/pm/stories/[story].md\n> Status: in_progress\n\n## Progress\n\n| #   | Task                       | Status     | Notes |\n| --- | -------------------------- | ---------- | ----- |\n| 1   | Define data models         | ⏳ pending |       |\n| 2   | Create database migrations | ⏳ pending |       |\n| 3   | Implement repository layer | ⏳ pending |       |\n\n## Tasks\n\n### Task 1: Define data models\n\n**Status**: ⏳ pending\n**Goal**: Create types for domain entities\n**Scope**: Entity types, DTOs, validation schemas\n**Acceptance Criteria**:\n\n- [ ] Types match business requirements\n- [ ] No type errors\n      **Dependencies**: None\n```\n\n## Task Types\n\n| Type       | Examples                       |\n| ---------- | ------------------------------ |\n| Data Model | Define entities, DTOs, schemas |\n| Database   | Migrations, indexes, seeds     |\n| Repository | Data access layer              |\n| Service    | Business logic                 |\n| API        | Controllers, routes            |\n| Validation | Input validation               |\n| Testing    | Unit, integration, API tests   |\n\n## Granularity Rules\n\n- Each task = independently testable\n- Each task = single responsibility\n- Each task = clear scope (not too big, not too small)\n\n## Key Rules\n\n- ALWAYS follow layered architecture order\n- MUST include test tasks for each layer\n- ALWAYS note dependencies between tasks\n- MUST save to `docs/reference/backend/tasks/` directory\n\n## Common Mistakes\n\n- ❌ Tasks too large (entire API) → ✅ Break into layers\n- ❌ Skip data model first → ✅ Types before implementation\n- ❌ Skip repository layer → ✅ Separate data access\n- ❌ Forget validation → ✅ Always include validation task\n"
