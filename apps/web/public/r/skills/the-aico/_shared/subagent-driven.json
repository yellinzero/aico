Two-stage review ensures both correctness and quality.\n\n  Use this skill when:\n  - Have implementation plan with multiple independent tasks\n  - Want automated execution with quality gates after each task\n  - Tasks are mostly independent (not tightly coupled)\n  - User asks to \"execute the plan\", \"run the tasks\", \"auto implement\"\n\n  Prerequisites: Must have plan from aico-frontend-plan, aico-backend-plan, or aico-*-task-breakdown skill.\n  Process: For each task: Dispatch Implementer → Spec Review (passes?) → Quality Review (passes?) → Next task\n  Review order: ALWAYS spec compliance first, THEN code quality.\n---\n\n# Subagent-Driven Development\n\n## Process\n\n```\n1. Read plan, extract all tasks\n      ↓\n2. Create task list with TaskCreate for all tasks\n      ↓\n3. For each task:\n   a. Dispatch Implementer Subagent\n   b. Implementer: implement and test\n   c. Dispatch Spec Reviewer (matches spec?)\n   d. Spec issues? → Implementer fixes → re-review\n   e. Dispatch Quality Reviewer (code quality?)\n   f. Quality issues? → Implementer fixes → re-review\n   g. Mark task complete\n      ↓\n4. All tasks complete → Final review → Done\n```\n\n## Review Order is Critical\n\n```\nSpec Compliance Review FIRST\n        ↓\n    ✅ Passes\n        ↓\nCode Quality Review SECOND\n```\n\n**Why:** No point reviewing code quality if it doesn't meet spec.\n\n## Subagent Prompts\n\n### Implementer\n\n- Provide FULL task text (don't make subagent read file)\n- Provide context (where task fits in plan)\n- Require TDD and self-review\n\n### Spec Reviewer\n\n- Check: Does implementation match spec exactly?\n- Missing anything? Added anything extra?\n\n### Quality Reviewer\n\n- Check: Tests, readability, error handling, performance, security\n- Rate issues as Critical/Important/Minor\n\n## Key Rules\n\n- ALWAYS run both reviews (spec AND quality)\n- MUST fix issues before proceeding to next task\n- NEVER dispatch multiple implementers in parallel\n- ALWAYS provide full task text to subagent\n- Spec review FIRST, then quality review\n\n## Red Flags\n\n**Never:**\n\n- Skip any review\n- Proceed with unfixed issues\n- Start quality review before spec passes\n- Move to next task with open issues\n\n**If issues found:**\n\n- Same implementer fixes them\n- Reviewer reviews again\n- Repeat until approved\n\n## Common Mistakes\n\n- ❌ Skip spec review → ✅ Always verify spec first\n- ❌ Skip quality review → ✅ Always check quality\n- ❌ Wrong review order → ✅ Spec first, then quality\n- ❌ Provide partial task text → ✅ Give full text\n"
