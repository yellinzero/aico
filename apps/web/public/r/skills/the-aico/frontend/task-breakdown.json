Tasks are ordered by UI development layers, not random order.\n\n  Use this skill when:\n  - Running /frontend.tasks command\n  - User asks to \"break down story\", \"create frontend tasks\", \"split into tasks\"\n  - Have story at docs/reference/pm/stories/ and need organized task list\n  - Need tasks ordered by UI development layers (not random order)\n  - Starting frontend work and want organized task list\n\n  Task order is CRITICAL: Setup → Static UI → Dynamic → Interactions → Tests\n  Output: ALWAYS write to docs/reference/frontend/tasks/{story-name}.md\n---\n\n# Task Breakdown\n\n## Language Configuration\n\nBefore generating any content, check `aico.json` in project root for `language` field to determine the output language. If not set, default to English.\n\n## Process\n\n1. **Read story/PRD**: Load from `docs/reference/pm/stories/` or `docs/reference/pm/versions/`\n2. **Read design** (if exists): Load from `docs/reference/frontend/designs/`\n3. **Identify components**: What UI elements are needed\n4. **Identify interactions**: What logic and events are needed\n5. **Break into tasks**: Independently testable, single responsibility\n6. **Order by dependencies**: Setup → Static UI → Dynamic → Tests\n7. **Save output**: ALWAYS write to `docs/reference/frontend/tasks/{story-name}.md`\n\n## Task File Template\n\n```markdown\n# [Story Name] - Frontend Tasks\n\n> Project: [project-name]\n> Created: YYYY-MM-DD\n> Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD\n> Source: docs/reference/pm/stories/[story].md\n> Design: docs/reference/frontend/designs/[name].md\n> Status: in_progress\n\n## Progress\n\n| Task                         | Status         | Notes |\n| ---------------------------- | -------------- | ----- |\n| 1. Setup component structure | ✅ completed   |       |\n| 2. Implement header section  | 🔄 in_progress |       |\n| 3. Implement content section | ⏳ pending     |       |\n\n## Tasks\n\n### Task 1: [Task Name]\n\n**Status**: ⏳ pending\n**Goal**: What this task achieves\n**Scope**: Files to create/modify\n**Acceptance Criteria**:\n\n- [ ] Criterion 1\n- [ ] Criterion 2\n      **Dependencies**: Task X (if any)\n```\n\n## Task Types\n\n| Type        | Examples                                |\n| ----------- | --------------------------------------- |\n| Setup       | Create component structure, setup state |\n| UI          | Implement section/component layout      |\n| Logic       | Add form validation, API integration    |\n| Interaction | Implement hover, click, animations      |\n| Testing     | Unit tests, integration tests           |\n\n## Granularity Rules\n\n- Each task = independently testable\n- Each task = single responsibility\n- Each task = clear scope (not too big, not too small)\n\n## Ordering Rules\n\n1. Setup tasks first\n2. Static UI before dynamic\n3. Core functionality before edge cases\n4. Tests after implementation\n\n## Key Rules\n\n- ALWAYS include test tasks at the end\n- MUST note dependencies between tasks\n- ALWAYS save to `docs/reference/frontend/tasks/` directory\n- Keep tasks focused - not too big, not too small\n\n## Common Mistakes\n\n- ❌ Tasks too large (full page) → ✅ Break into sections\n- ❌ Tasks too small (add one button) → ✅ Group related work\n- ❌ Skip dependencies → ✅ Note which tasks depend on others\n- ❌ Forget testing → ✅ Always include test tasks\n"
