Tasks are ordered by UI development layers.\n\n  Use this skill when:\n  - Running /frontend.tasks command\n  - User asks to \"break down story\", \"create frontend tasks\", \"split into tasks\"\n  - Have story at docs/reference/pm/stories/ and need organized task breakdown\n  - Need tasks ordered by UI development layers (not random order)\n  - Starting frontend work and want organized task list\n\n  Task order is CRITICAL: Setup → Static UI → Dynamic → Interactions → Tests\n  Output: Create single file docs/reference/frontend/tasks/story-{name}.md with all tasks\n---\n\n# Task Breakdown\n\n## ⚠️ CRITICAL RULES - READ FIRST\n\n**BEFORE doing anything, you MUST:**\n\n1. **CHECK EXISTING TASK FILE FIRST**:\n   - ALWAYS check if `story-{story-name}.md` already exists in `docs/reference/frontend/tasks/`\n   - If exists: READ it and continue from current progress (add new tasks or update existing ones)\n   - If not exists: Create new task breakdown file\n   - **NEVER re-break down existing tasks**\n\n2. **FILE NAMING**:\n   - Pattern: `story-{story-name}.md` (single file per story)\n   - Example: `story-user-profile.md`\n   - All tasks for this story go into this ONE file\n   - Tasks are separated by `---` dividers\n\n3. **MULTIPLE TASKS IN ONE FILE**:\n   - One file contains ALL tasks for the story\n   - Each task = independently testable section\n   - Clear scope and acceptance criteria per task\n   - Tasks numbered sequentially (Task 1, Task 2, etc.)\n\n4. **ALWAYS SAVE TO CORRECT PATH**:\n   - Path: `docs/reference/frontend/tasks/story-{story-name}.md`\n   - NO exceptions, NO other locations\n\n5. **READ CONTEXT FIRST**:\n   - Read story from `docs/reference/pm/stories/`\n   - Read design from `docs/reference/frontend/designs/` if exists\n   - Read design system from `docs/reference/frontend/design-system.md`\n   - Read constraints from `docs/reference/frontend/constraints.md`\n\n## Language Configuration\n\nBefore generating any content, check `aico.json` in project root for `language` field to determine the output language. If not set, default to English.\n\n## Process\n\n1. **Read story/PRD**: Load from `docs/reference/pm/stories/` or `docs/reference/pm/versions/`\n2. **Read design** (if exists): Load from `docs/reference/frontend/designs/`\n3. **Read constraints**: Load design system and technical constraints\n4. **Identify components**: What UI elements are needed\n5. **Identify interactions**: What logic and events are needed\n6. **Break into tasks**: Independently testable, single responsibility\n7. **Order by dependencies**: Setup → Static UI → Dynamic → Tests\n8. **Generate single file**: Create `story-{story-name}.md` with all tasks in sections\n9. **Update Story file**: Add \"Related Tasks\" section to story file with link to task file\n10. **Summary**: Show created file and next steps\n\n## Task File Format\n\nSee [Task File Template](references/task-file-template.md) for complete structure.\n\n**Key points:**\n\n- Single file contains all tasks for the story\n- Tasks numbered sequentially (Task 1, Task 2, etc.)\n- Each task has: Description, Context, Acceptance Criteria, Scope, Implementation Steps\n- Progress section at the end tracks completion\n- Both story-based and standalone use the same format (only filename differs)\n\n## Updating Story File\n\nAfter generating the task file, **ALWAYS** update the story file to add the \"Related Tasks\" section:\n\n```markdown\n## Related Tasks\n\n### Frontend Tasks\n\nTask breakdown: [docs/reference/frontend/tasks/story-user-profile.md](../frontend/tasks/story-user-profile.md)\n\n**Progress**: 0/5 tasks completed\n\n- [ ] Task 1: Setup Component\n- [ ] Task 2: Implement Header\n- [ ] Task 3: Implement Avatar\n- [ ] Task 4: Implement Bio\n- [ ] Task 5: Add Tests\n```\n\n**Key points:**\n\n- Add this section at the end of the story file (before any existing notes)\n- Include link to the task file\n- Use `- [ ]` checkboxes for each task (will be checked when task completes)\n- List tasks in execution order (Setup → UI → Logic → Tests)\n- Keep the section organized by frontend/backend if both exist\n- Include progress counter (X/Y tasks completed)\n\n## Output Example\n\nAfter breaking down \"user-profile\" story:\n\n```\nCreated task file for story 'user-profile':\n\n✓ docs/reference/frontend/tasks/story-user-profile.md\n\nTask breakdown includes:\n- Task 1: Setup Component Structure (setup)\n- Task 2: Implement Header Section (feature)\n- Task 3: Implement Avatar Component (feature)\n- Task 4: Implement Bio Section (feature)\n- Task 5: Add Comprehensive Tests (testing)\n\nTotal: 5 tasks\n\nNext steps:\n1. Review task breakdown in story-user-profile.md\n2. Use /frontend.plan to add detailed steps to specific tasks\n3. Use /frontend.implement to start executing tasks\n```\n\n## Key Rules\n\n- ALWAYS create a single file containing all tasks for the story\n- MUST use `story-{story-name}.md` naming (NOT multiple files)\n- ALWAYS include test tasks at the end\n- MUST note dependencies between tasks (in each task's metadata)\n- Keep tasks focused - not too big, not too small\n- Each task section is self-contained with clear acceptance criteria\n- Separate tasks with `---` dividers\n- Include Story Progress section at the end of file\n\n## Common Mistakes\n\n- ❌ Tasks too large (full page) → ✅ Break into sections\n- ❌ Tasks too small (add one button) → ✅ Group related work\n- ❌ Skip dependencies → ✅ Note which tasks depend on others\n- ❌ Forget testing → ✅ Always include test tasks\n- ❌ Create multiple files → ✅ Use single file with multiple task sections\n"
