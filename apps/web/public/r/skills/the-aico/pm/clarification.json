Provides expert recommendations for each decision.\n\n  Use this skill when:\n  - Running /pm.clarify command\n  - User says \"unclear\", \"not sure what this means\", \"confused about\"\n  - User asks \"what does X mean?\", \"how should X work?\", \"can you clarify?\"\n  - Requirements have conflicting or inconsistent details\n  - Stories are missing acceptance criteria or have gaps\n  - Need to fill information gaps BEFORE development can proceed\n\n  Process: Ask ONE question at a time (max 5 per session), provide recommended option with reasoning.\n  DO NOT ask multiple questions at once - this overwhelms users.\n---\n\n# Requirement Clarification\n\n## ⚠️ CRITICAL RULES - READ FIRST\n\n1. **SEARCH FIRST**: Always search `docs/reference/pm/` for related documents before asking questions\n2. **ONE QUESTION AT A TIME**: Max 5 questions per session\n3. **UPDATE DOCUMENTS**: After clarification, update the relevant story/version files\n\n## Language Configuration\n\nBefore generating any content, check `aico.json` in project root for `language` field to determine the output language. If not set, default to English.\n\n## Process\n\n1. **Scan context**: Check `docs/reference/pm/` for existing documentation\n2. **Identify ambiguities**: Categorize by type (scope, behavior, data, edge cases)\n3. **Prioritize**: Sort by impact: scope > security > UX > technical\n4. **Ask ONE question at a time**: Max 5 questions per session\n5. **Provide recommendation**: Each question should have a recommended option with reasoning\n6. **Update docs**: Document each answer immediately\n\n## Question Format\n\n```markdown\n### Question [N]: [Topic]\n\n**Context**: [Quote relevant requirement]\n\n**Ambiguity**: [What's unclear]\n\n**Options**:\n| Option | Description | Implications |\n|--------|-------------|--------------|\n| A | [First option] | [Trade-offs] |\n| B | [Second option] | [Trade-offs] |\n\n**Recommended**: [Option] because [reasoning]\n```\n\n## Ambiguity Categories\n\n| Category       | Focus                      |\n| -------------- | -------------------------- |\n| Scope          | What's included/excluded   |\n| Behavior       | How feature should work    |\n| Data           | What information is needed |\n| Edge cases     | Unusual scenarios          |\n| Error handling | Failure modes              |\n\n## Key Rules\n\n- ALWAYS ask ONE question per message, never batch\n- MUST provide recommended option with reasoning for each question\n- ALWAYS prioritize blocking issues (scope, security) over minor details\n- Max 5 questions per clarification session\n\n## Common Mistakes\n\n- ❌ Ask all questions at once → ✅ One at a time\n- ❌ Open-ended questions → ✅ Multiple choice with recommendation\n- ❌ Low-impact questions → ✅ Focus on blocking issues first\n"
