If not set, default to English.\n\n## Process\n\n1. **Gather context**: Check `docs/reference/pm/` for existing product context\n2. **Define problem & solution**: Start with clear problem statement and high-level solution\n3. **Set boundaries**: Clearly separate Goals from Non-Goals\n4. **Document requirements**: List functional requirements (FR-XXX format)\n5. **Define success**: Set measurable success criteria\n6. **Track unknowns**: Document open questions for later clarification\n7. **Save PRD**: ALWAYS write to `docs/reference/pm/versions/{version-name}.md`\n\n## PRD Template\n\n```markdown\n# [Feature Name] PRD\n\n> Project: [project-name]\n> Created: YYYY-MM-DD\n> Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD\n\n## 1. Overview\n\n- Problem statement\n- Proposed solution (high-level)\n- Success metrics\n\n## 2. Background\n\n- Current state\n- User pain points\n- Market context (if relevant)\n\n## 3. Goals & Non-Goals\n\n### Goals\n\n- What this feature WILL accomplish\n\n### Non-Goals\n\n- What this feature will NOT address\n\n## 4. User Stories\n\n[Link to or embed user stories]\n\n## 5. Functional Requirements\n\n- FR-001: [Requirement description]\n- FR-002: [Requirement description]\n\n## 6. User Experience\n\n- Key user flows\n- Interaction patterns\n- Edge cases\n\n## 7. Success Criteria\n\n- Measurable outcomes\n- Acceptance criteria\n\n## 8. Open Questions\n\n- Unresolved decisions\n- Items needing clarification\n```\n\n## Key Rules\n\n- ALWAYS focus on WHAT to build, NOT HOW to implement\n- MUST include quantifiable success metrics\n- ALWAYS explicitly state what's out of scope in Non-Goals\n- MUST save output to `docs/reference/pm/versions/` directory\n\n## Common Mistakes\n\n- ❌ Include implementation details → ✅ Focus on WHAT, not HOW\n- ❌ Vague success metrics → ✅ Quantifiable outcomes\n- ❌ Missing non-goals → ✅ Explicitly state what's out of scope\n\n---\n\n## Iron Law\n\n**NO PRD WITHOUT VALIDATED REQUIREMENTS**\n\nThis rule is non-negotiable. Before writing PRD:\n\n1. User pain points must be documented\n2. Success metrics must be defined\n3. Scope must be explicitly approved by user\n\n### Rationalization Defense\n\n| Excuse                          | Reality                                 |\n| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |\n| \"Requirements are clear enough\" | Implicit requirements cause scope creep |\n| \"We can refine the PRD later\"   | Late changes cost 10x more to implement |\n| \"User will accept anything\"     | Users always have hidden expectations   |\n| \"It's just a small feature\"     | Small features grow into big problems   |\n"
