Uses one-question-at-a-time approach with multiple choice options.\n\n  Use this skill when:\n  - User says \"I have an idea\", \"I want to build\", \"let me think about\"\n  - User mentions \"brainstorm\", \"explore ideas\", \"think through\"\n  - Requirements are vague, incomplete, or user seems unsure what they want\n  - Need to explore problem space before jumping to solutions\n  - Running /pm.plan but requirements are unclear or missing context\n  - User asks \"what should I build?\", \"how should this work?\"\n\n  Process: Ask ONE question at a time, prefer multiple choice, explore 2-3 approaches before settling.\n---\n\n# Brainstorming\n\n## Language Configuration\n\nBefore generating any content, check `aico.json` in project root for `language` field to determine the output language. If not set, default to English.\n\n## Process\n\n1. **Check context**: Scan `docs/reference/pm/` for existing product context\n2. **Understand problem**: Ask clarifying questions one at a time\n3. **Explore alternatives**: Propose 2-3 approaches with trade-offs\n4. **Validate concept**: Present ideas in small sections (200-300 words), confirm each\n5. **Document outcome**: Save validated concept for next steps\n\n## Core Pattern\n\n| Phase      | Action                                 | Output            |\n| ---------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------- |\n| Understand | Ask clarifying questions one at a time | Problem statement |\n| Explore    | Propose 2-3 approaches with trade-offs | Selected approach |\n| Validate   | Present concept in small sections      | Validated concept |\n\n## Key Rules\n\n- ALWAYS ask ONE question per message - never overwhelm with multiple questions\n- MUST prefer multiple choice over open-ended questions when possible\n- ALWAYS explore 2-3 alternative approaches before settling on one\n- Present ideas incrementally in 200-300 word sections, confirm each before continuing\n\n## Question Examples\n\n- \"What problem are you trying to solve for users?\"\n- \"Who is the primary user for this feature?\"\n- \"What does success look like? (A) metric improvement (B) user satisfaction (C) both\"\n\n## Common Mistakes\n\n- ❌ Ask multiple questions at once → ✅ One question per message\n- ❌ Jump to solutions immediately → ✅ Understand problem first\n- ❌ Skip alternatives → ✅ Always explore 2-3 approaches\n\n---\n\n## Iron Law\n\n**NO IMPLEMENTATION DISCUSSION DURING BRAINSTORMING**\n\nThis rule is non-negotiable. During brainstorming:\n\n1. Focus only on WHAT, never HOW\n2. No code, no architecture, no technical details\n3. Capture all ideas without judgment\n4. Defer feasibility analysis to later phases\n\n### Rationalization Defense\n\n| Excuse                                       | Reality                                        |\n| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |\n| \"I already know what to build\"               | Unvalidated assumptions cause 3x rework        |\n| \"Let's save time and discuss implementation\" | Premature optimization kills innovation        |\n| \"The solution is obvious\"                    | Obvious solutions often miss edge cases        |\n| \"We don't have time for this\"                | 1 hour of brainstorming saves 3 days of rework |\n"
