If not set, default to English.\n\n## Process\n\n1. **Identify user type**: Who benefits from this feature\n2. **Define goal**: What they want to do\n3. **Clarify value**: Why it matters to them\n4. **Write acceptance criteria**: 3-5 Given/When/Then scenarios\n5. **Add metadata**: Priority, complexity, dependencies\n6. **Save story**: ALWAYS write to `docs/reference/pm/stories/{story-name}.md`\n\n## Story Template\n\n```markdown\n# [STORY-ID] Story Title\n\n> Project: [project-name]\n> Created: YYYY-MM-DD\n> Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD\n\n**As a** [user type]\n**I want** [goal/action]\n**So that** [benefit/value]\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Given [context], when [action], then [expected result]\n- [ ] Given [context], when [action], then [expected result]\n- [ ] Given [context], when [action], then [expected result]\n\n### Notes\n\n- Priority: P1/P2/P3\n- Estimated complexity: S/M/L/XL\n- Dependencies: [list any dependencies]\n```\n\n## Key Rules\n\n- ALWAYS specify the user type (who benefits)\n- MUST focus on user value, not technical solution\n- ALWAYS include 3-5 testable acceptance criteria\n- Use Given/When/Then format for all criteria\n- MUST save to `docs/reference/pm/stories/` directory\n\n## Common Mistakes\n\n- ❌ Vague acceptance criteria → ✅ Specific, testable conditions\n- ❌ Solution-focused stories → ✅ Focus on user value\n- ❌ Missing user type → ✅ Always specify who benefits\n"
